## About the examples

### Examples from the book
These are the examples used in the [Domain Storytelling book](https://leanpub.com/domainstorytelling) written by Stefan Hofer and Henning Schwentner:

- Alphorn car leasing: The stories named 1 and 1a show on a coarse-grained level how this leasing company operates. The stories with *payment*, *offering*, and *risk assessment* in their name show subdomains of Alphorn in more detail.
- Metropolis arthouse cinema: The manager of this small, old-fashioned cinema wants to introduce an app for movie-goers.
- Opening stories: Several chapter in the book open with a story that explains the content of the chapter. Domain stories describing Domain Storytelling—that's how we have fun!
- Travel: Three stories about traveling. They illustrate that Domain Storytelling works in different natural languages, e.g., German, Chinese, and Farsi. 

### More examples
- Organizing an investment conference: This story was modeled with a real domain expert in a meetup. [Watch the recording of the session on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9k9Szkdprk)!
- External authentication provider: This story illustrates that domain stories can be about technical processes too. It is an anonymized real-world example of a web app that uses an external provider to manage user accounts.
